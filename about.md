I'm a software developer interested in machine learning, software quality, robustness, systems performance and clean everything: code,
architecture, development process, operations.

I've worked with these languages over the years:

`C`, `C++`, `SQL`, `PL/SQL`, `shell` scripting, `Perl`, `Java`, `Lisp`, `C#`, `Scala`, `Haskell`, `Python`, `Matlab`/`Octave`, `JavaScript` and others.

I think you should learn a new language every now and then to expand your programming vocabulary and learn better ways
of doing things. If a language offers you a new paradigm, new abstractions, safer (or unsafer :)) environment, or makes you think
in a totally different way than before, you should learn it, even if you are not going to use it for your daily job.

I'm hoping to write about anything interesting that I come across in my professional life be it programming, machine
learning or related topics.

I'll try to come up with a less boring About page later, let's see how it goes first... :)

You can find some of my small projects and experiments on GitHub:
